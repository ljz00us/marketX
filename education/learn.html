        <h2>the Basics</h2>

        <div class = "question">What is equity?</div>

        <div class = "answer">Equity is <u>stock</u>.  Stock is just a piece of paper entitling you to a portion of the company’s profit every year.</div><br><img src = "http://www.learnliberty.org/wp-content/themes/learnliberty-2013/img/academy-icons/icon-certificate.png"><br>

        <div class = "question">Right.  So what is it exactly?</div>
        
        <div class = "answer">Say you wanted to set up a lemonade stand. All you need to buy is a table, a jug, a few lemons, a few cups, and paper for a sign.  So your costs are around $50.  <br><br>

        <img src = "https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/lemonade.png?w=640">

        <br><br>Now, if you sold each cup of lemonade for $5, after 10 customers, you’d make $50 in revenue. Which is great. So now your revenue equals your <u>costs.</u> <br><br>If you sold one more glass of lemonade, you just made profit a $5 profit.  That's awesome. <br><br>

        <div class = "question">But what if I had shareholders?</div>

        Ok so let's say instead you begged your parents for money and they gave you $50.  <br><br> Now, things are different.  That $5 profit partly <u>belongs to them</u>.  Because they are now your shareholders.<br><br>
