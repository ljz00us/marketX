<strong><em>Q:  I recently joined a startup.  They are giving me equity.  I don't even know what equity is.  What is it?  Why does it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">change price</span>?  Will it trade on the NY stock exchange?  Thanks.  </em></strong>

<br><br>

Equity is stock.  It's just a piece of paper entitling you to a portion of the company's profit every year.

Stock is what makes our economy tick.  It was one of the key ingredients to industrialization in the U.S. and Europe.

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q:  Right.  So what is it exactly?  </em></strong>

<br><br>

Say you wanted to set up a lemonade stand. All you need to buy is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a table</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a jug</span>, a few <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lemons</span>, a few <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cups</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">paper</span> for a sign.  So Costs = $50 maximum.

<br><br>

If you sold each cup of lemonade for $5.  After 10 customers, you'd make a profit, which  you get to keep entirely. <strong> </strong>We'll just say the equity - i.e. the "rights" to the profit - is all owned by you.

<br><br>

</center>

<br><br>

But what if you wanted to make clothes?  A car factory?  A spaceship?   That's expensive.  Thousands or millions (!) of dollars in costs.  And you might flop.

<br><br>

You don't have that kind of cash, and even if you did, one business screw-up and it's all gone.  So what do you do?

<br><br>

So you'd sell stock instead.  You'd sell $1 each, and maybe try to sell it to 1000 people.  This would raise you $1000.

<br><br>

But you'd have to promise them - your "shareholders" - a certain percentage of all future profits.  Forever.

<br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screen-shot-2015-03-15-at-4-42-50-pm.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-134" src="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screen-shot-2015-03-15-at-4-42-50-pm.png?w=300" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-15 at 4.42.50 PM" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q:  So I have to give up my profits to my shareholders.</em></strong>

<br><br>

Well, not really "give-up".  They are entitled to part of it, because they invested in you early on.  But you keep some of it too.

<br><br>

&nbsp;

<strong><em>Q:  Uh ... can you give some context?</em></strong>

<br><br>

The first stock certificate was issued by a large Dutch shipping company called the Dutch East India Company back in 1606.  It looked like this:

<br><br>

<a href="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/first_stock.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-125 aligncenter" src="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/first_stock.png?w=300" alt="first_stock" width="300" height="204" /></a>

<br><br>

Their primary business was sending ships to Asia to buy spices, then selling the spice in Europe.  It was actually a fantastic business.  European demand for Asian spices was massive.

<br><br>

It was also dangerous.  Traveling over land, with storms, diseases, wars, warlords, pirates, you name it.  The whole thing could end up costing millions, and in the end the goods might never arrive back to Europe.

<br><br>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">So to reduce the risk, the company issued <strong>stock</strong>.  They issued that piece of paper above that basically said for "you giving us $50 (or whatever it was) now, and we'll promise you some profits for our company every year - - - as long as you hold this piece of paper."</span>

<br><br>

No one knew how much profits would be when buying that certificate, of course.  Maybe the ship would be robbed by bandits.  Or there would be a mutiny.  Or there was a typhoon that dumped all the spices onto the ocean floor.

<br><br>

Basically, the greater the risks to those future profits, the lower the stock price went.  And the lesser the risks, the greater the stock price

<br><br>

<a href="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screen-shot-2015-03-15-at-4-35-16-pm.png"><img class="  wp-image-133 aligncenter" src="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screen-shot-2015-03-15-at-4-35-16-pm.png?w=300" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-15 at 4.35.16 PM" width="442" height="252" /></a>

<br><br>

Of course, the company tended to want to raise as much money as possible.  So it would do its best to convince shareholders on how they would <strong>reduce those risks to increase profits</strong>.

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q:  How do the shareholders know how much to initially pay for the stock?</em></strong>

<br><br>

It's not easy.  If people could accurately guess that, they'd be rich.

Remember ...

<br><br>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screen-shot-2015-03-15-at-4-35-16-pm.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-133" src="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screen-shot-2015-03-15-at-4-35-16-pm.png?w=300" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-15 at 4.35.16 PM" width="396" height="226" /></a></p>

<br><br>

... and so there are a lot of factors that can impact "future profits", like:

<br><br>

<ul>
	<li>the company's CEO quits.  Shows he / she doesn't have confidence.  Stock price goes <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>down</strong></span>.</li>
	<li>the economy falters.  The company's market no longer has demand.  Stock price <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>down</strong></span>.</li>
	<li>interest rates rise.  If the company relies on lots of debt to operate, this will raise their costs.  Profits decline.  Stock price <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>down</strong></span>.</li>
	<li>the industry is disrupted.  Netflix comes into town and eats up Blockbuster.  "No one saw it coming," says the CEO.  Stock price <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">down</span></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

That's why investing in the market can be complex.  At any given time, there are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>dozens of variables</strong></span> that are both <strong>pushing</strong> and <strong>pulling</strong> on the company's stock price.  Sometimes it's related to the economy, and sometimes it's related to the company itself.

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q:  So how do those finance people figure this stuff out?</em></strong>

<br><br>

You estimate profits every year for the next 10 years or so for that company.  It's not always scientific.  You look at a combination of company-specific metrics as well as economic data.

<br><br>

There is a formula that can help too ...

<a href="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/discounted-cash-flows.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-132 aligncenter" src="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/discounted-cash-flows.png?w=300" alt="discounted cash flows" width="300" height="116" /></a>

<br><br>

.. with each "C" being the cash flow for the company.  And then discounting each cash flow back to today.

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q:  HUH ... ?  I don't get it.  That looks like a nightmare.  </em></strong>

<br><br>

It's not.  Really.  I'll go into it later.

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q: So is my stock trading on the stock exchange?  </em></strong>

<br><br>

No.  Startups look more like the lemonade stand I talked about. To get "listed" on the stock exchange, you need to be very big.  Like earning-millions-of-dollars big.  Early stage start-ups rarely make money.  Some actually lose money for a few years first.  Some don't even have a product to sell.

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q:  Hey, that's my startup!  So that means ... ?</em></strong>

<br><br>

That means you're stock probably isn't worth much.  Maybe just a few cents per share.

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q:  NO!!!  Those bastards!  They're paying me with worthless equity?!</em></strong>

<br><br>

Not necessarily.  The stock could be worth something soon.  Just not yet.  And presumably they hired you because you believe in their idea.

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q:  So when will it be worth something?   When can I sell it and buy a house?  </em></strong>

<br><br>

I'll review what I said before ...

<br><br>

<a href="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screen-shot-2015-03-15-at-4-35-16-pm.png"><img class="  wp-image-133 aligncenter" src="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screen-shot-2015-03-15-at-4-35-16-pm.png?w=300" alt="Screen Shot 2015-03-15 at 4.35.16 PM" width="449" height="256" /></a>

<br><br>

So in order for a company's equity to actually be worth something, you need to prove you will make profit.  OR somehow convince investors that you MIGHT be able to make profit.

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q:  But look at Twitter and Facebook and Amazon ... They all were so-called "worth millions" without profits ...</em></strong>

<br><br>

That's because they had millions of users.  It took them many years to get there.  Their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">potential</span> for earning was very high.  They could slap up an ad on their website, and <strong>if just 1% of people clicked on it, they could generate profit for that seller.  </strong>They chose not to do that so they could develop their platform.

<br><br>

<strong><em>Q:  I think my startup raised some money.  Someone said something about a "Series A" or something.  </em></strong>

<br><br>

That's a good sign.  Funding is usually done in "stages".  The first stage is usually called a "seed" stage.  Like a the seed of a flower ...

<br><br>

<a href="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/seed.jpeg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-135 aligncenter" src="https://lexitdotco.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/seed.jpeg" alt="seed" width="225" height="225" /></a>

<br><br>

This "seed" money usually comes from friends, family members, or so-called "Angel" investors - wealthy people with money to throw away on new ideas .  They have lots of money and time to help founders with their startup ideas.

<br><br>

They traditionally invest $250K-$2 million for the startup.  This "seed" money helps the startup hire 1-2 more people that can actually help build and launch a product.

<br><br>

These startups are risky.  Many startups never get out of this stage, so as of now, only "wealthier" people - e.g. people with assets of +$1 million or annual income of $200,000 / year - are legally allowed to do this.

<br><br>

After the seed round, and if the startup is successful in getting that first few customers, then they can go back to venture capital investors to get what's called a "<strong>Series A</strong>" round.  And then, after usually a few more rounds, if it's still successful, it goes public.

<br><br>

You can see a more detailed infographic of this <a href="http://fundersandfounders.com/how-funding-works-splitting-equity/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br><br>

<strong>Q:  Great, so I can just wait till it goes public, then invest in it, and then make my money?  </strong>

<br><br>

Because of something called dilution, later-stage investors tend to make less returns on their investment.  But the risks tend to be lower.

<br><br>

<strong>Q:  But that's not fair.  These startups are making lots of money, and why can't us plebes get some of it? </strong>

<br><br>

It might happen soon.  Congress and the SEC are working on laws that might allow investors to do this more easily.  But now it depends on which state you live in.  Which, of course, limits your investment opportunities.

<br><br>

Also, Angel investors are presumed to understand the risks better.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>After all, 9 out of 10 startups will fail</strong></span>.  But that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>one</strong></span> that does succeed ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>that</strong></span> makes them a lot of money.

<br><br>

More on this later.  Stay tuned.
